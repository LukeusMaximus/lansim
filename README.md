Current Project Status
----------------------

We worked on this in 2008, for our college project. It would not be wrong to say, as of now it is dormant and abandoned. This project has been migrated from sf.net to here.

Introduction
------------

LANSim is a CNet-like network simulator. It aims to be very easy to use GUI based network simulator. We started this (and is still is) our college semester project.

This is meant to be user friendly as well as feature rich. This field lacks software with good user interface except for the very popular CNet (which is still not available for Windows platform). The commercial softwares in this field are too complicated. This aimed to go along Multisim(R) and Blender(R) way. As user-friendly as Multisim and as functional as [Blender][bl].
